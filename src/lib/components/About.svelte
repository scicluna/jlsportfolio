  <h1 class="font-extralight text-5xl">Who am I?</h1>
  <p class="text-2xl font-bold sm:leading-loose">
    With a solid foundation in web development from my bootcamp training, I'm
    eager to apply my skills in a practical environment. I consider myself a
    visionary - always looking for innovative solutions and constantly driven by
    my thirst for knowledge. My dedication to learning something new each day is
    a core tenet of my work ethic. It's not just about gaining knowledge, but
    also about understanding how to apply that knowledge effectively in
    real-world scenarios. I'm seeking an opportunity where I can further develop
    these skills and contribute meaningfully to a team. I'm confident that given
    the chance, I can exceed expectations and bring a unique perspective to your
    organization. In me, you'll find a programmer who is dedicated, proactive,
    and continually striving for excellence. I invite you to join me on this
    journey as I take my first steps into the professional world, and I'm
    confident that together, we can achieve great things.
